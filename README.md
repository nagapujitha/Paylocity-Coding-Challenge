# Paylocity-Coding-Challenge
Business Need: 
One of the critical functions that we provide for our clients is the ability to pay for their employees’ benefits 
packages. A portion of these costs are deducted from their paycheck, and we handle that deduction. Please 
demonstrate how you would code the following scenario: 

1. The cost of benefits is $1000/year for each employee 
2. Each dependent (children and possibly spouses) incurs a cost of $500/year 
3. Anyone whose name starts with ‘A’ gets a 10% discount, employee or dependent 

Please implement a web application based on these assumptions: 
1. All employees are paid $2000 per paycheck before deductions 
2. There are 26 paychecks in a year 

# Technologies Used
1. Visual Studio Enterprise 2017 
2. .NET Framework 4.6.1
3. ASP.NET MVC 5.2.7
